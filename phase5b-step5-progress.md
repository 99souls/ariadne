- **Features**:
  - Rule evaluation logging with business context
  - Strategy execution logging with performance metrics
  - Configuration change logging
  - Business outcome logging
  - Configurable log levels and output formats (JSON/text)
- **Integration**: Comprehensive business context logging across all operations

#### 5. HealthCheckSystem
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive health monitoring for all business components
- **Capabilities**:
  - Pluggable health check function registration
  - Component-level health status tracking
  - Overall system health aggregation
  - HTTP endpoint for health monitoring
  - Health check results with detailed metadata
- **Integration**: Ready for integration with all business components

#### 6. IntegratedMonitoringSystem
- **Purpose**: Unified monitoring facade combining all monitoring components
- **Features**:
  - End-to-end rule evaluation monitoring
  - Strategy execution monitoring with observability
  - Configuration change monitoring
  - Composed strategy execution monitoring
  - Unified metrics and health status access
- **Integration**: Complete integration with business policies and strategy composition

## Architecture Integration

### Business Logic Integration
```
BusinessPolicies → MonitoringSystem → ObservabilityExport
     ↓                    ↓                    ↓
RuleEvaluation → BusinessMetrics → PrometheusMetrics
     ↓                    ↓                    ↓
StrategyExecution → Tracing → DistributedTracing
```

### Data Flow
1. **Business Operations** generate events (rule evaluations, strategy executions)
2. **BusinessMetricsCollector** aggregates operational metrics
3. **Exporters** (Prometheus/OpenTelemetry) expose metrics for external systems
4. **StructuredLogger** provides contextual business logging
5. **HealthCheckSystem** monitors component health status
