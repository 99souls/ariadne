# Site Scraper Implementation Plan

_Agentic workflow optimized for systematic development_

## Development Philosophy

- **Iterative Development**: Build, test, refine in small increments
- **Early Validation**: Test each component independently before integration
- **Measurable Progress**: Clear success criteria for each milestone
- **Fail-Fast Approach**: Identify and resolve blockers quickly

### 2.2 Content Processing Workers

- [x] Create worker pool pattern for content processing
- [x] Implement HTML-to-Markdown conversion pipeline

## Phase 3: Concurrency & Performance Optimization

**Timeline: Day 3-4 | Success Metric: Process 500+ pages efficiently with resource monitoring**

### 3.1 Multi-Stage Pipeline Architecture

- [x] Implement channel-based pipeline stages:
  - URL Discovery → Content Extraction → Processing → Output
- [x] Add backpressure handling between stages
- [x] Create worker pools for each stage with configurable sizing
- [x] Implement graceful shutdown with context cancellation

### 3.2 Intelligent Rate Limiting

- [x] Implement adaptive rate limiter based on server responses
- [x] Add per-domain rate limiting capabilities
- [x] Create circuit breaker for server overload detection
- [x] Add retry logic with exponential backoff

### 3.3 Resource Management

- [ ] Implement memory monitoring and management
- [ ] Add content caching with LRU eviction
- [ ] Create disk spillover for large datasets
- [ ] Add progress checkpointing for resumable crawls

**Validation Test**: Crawl 500+ page site within memory limits, complete within expected timeframe.

## Phase 4: Output Generation System

**Timeline: Day 4-5 | Success Metric: Generate high-quality PDF, MD, and HTML outputs**

### 4.1 Multi-Format Output Engine

- [ ] Implement markdown compilation with table of contents
- [ ] Create HTML template system for web output
- [ ] Add PDF generation pipeline (markdown → HTML → PDF)
- [ ] Implement output format plugins for extensibility

### 4.2 Document Assembly

- [ ] Create document structure organizing by URL hierarchy
- [ ] Generate navigation and cross-reference links
- [ ] Implement content deduplication logic
- [ ] Add metadata extraction and inclusion

### 4.3 Content Enhancement

- [ ] Generate automatic table of contents
- [ ] Create index of pages and sections
- [ ] Add search functionality for HTML output
- [ ] Implement custom CSS styling for professional appearance

**Validation Test**: Generate publication-ready documents in all three formats from 100+ page crawl.

## Phase 5: Production Readiness

**Timeline: Day 5-6 | Success Metric: Production-ready tool with comprehensive error handling**

### 5.1 Configuration Management

- [ ] Create comprehensive YAML configuration system
- [ ] Add command-line argument parsing
- [ ] Implement configuration validation and defaults
- [ ] Add site-specific configuration profiles

### 5.2 Error Handling & Recovery

- [ ] Implement comprehensive error classification
- [ ] Add failed URL retry queue with intelligent retry logic
- [ ] Create partial completion support (generate from successful pages)
- [ ] Add detailed error reporting and logging

### 5.3 Monitoring & Observability

- [ ] Implement real-time progress reporting
- [ ] Add performance metrics (pages/sec, memory usage, error rates)
- [ ] Create completion time estimation
- [ ] Add structured logging with multiple verbosity levels

- **Medium sites (100-500 pages)**: Complete in under 10 minutes
- **Large sites (500+ pages)**: Maintain >50 pages/minute throughput

### Quality Standards

- **Content Fidelity**: 95% of formatting preserved in conversion
- **Link Integrity**: 98% of internal links working in output
- **Error Rate**: <5% failed pages on typical wiki sites
- **Memory Efficiency**: <2GB peak memory for 1000+ page sites

### User Experience Goals

- **Configuration**: Site scraping configured in <5 minutes
- **Progress Visibility**: Clear progress indication throughout process
- **Error Communication**: Clear, actionable error messages
- **Output Quality**: Professional-looking documents suitable for distribution

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- **Memory Overflow**: Implement streaming processing and disk spillover
- **Rate Limiting**: Build adaptive throttling and respectful crawling
- **Site Variations**: Create flexible content extraction patterns
- **Format Compatibility**: Extensive testing across different site structures

### Implementation Risks

- **Scope Creep**: Stick to core features, defer advanced features to v2
- **Over-Engineering**: Focus on working solution first, optimize later
- **Testing Gaps**: Test with multiple real-world sites throughout development
- **Performance Issues**: Profile and optimize at each phase boundary
