## Entries

- 2025-09-27T00:00:00Z | Iteration 1 (scaffolding) | Added `configx` package with `model.go`, `layers.go`; introduced basic tests for layer precedence and model marshaling; deferred CLI scope per revised instructions. Next: implement resolver + deep merge (Iteration 2) after verifying coverage & lint.
- 2025-09-27T00:00:00Z | Iteration 2 (resolver + deep merge) | Added `resolver.go` with deep merge semantics (scalars override, slices replace, maps merge, cloning to avoid mutation); tests cover precedence, map merging, slice replacement & immutability. Next: Iteration 3 (store + versioning + hashing).
- 2025-09-27T00:00:00Z | Iteration 3 (store + versioning + hashing) | Added `store.go` (append-only in-memory versioned store), `audit.go` (audit record model); implemented hashing (SHA256 canonical JSON), parent version enforcement, hash verification, audit immutability; tests: append/head, parent mismatch, verify, audit immutability. Next: Iteration 4 (validation + simulation stubs).
- 2025-09-27T00:00:00Z | Iteration 4 (validation + simulation) | Added `validation.go` with semantic checks (rollout mode, percentage bounds, negative guards) and `simulation.go` stub impact model; tests cover validation errors, flag/rule deltas, no-change notes, and latency heuristic. Next: Iteration 5 (apply pipeline + rollback orchestration).
- 2025-09-27T00:00:00Z | Iteration 5 (apply pipeline + rollback) | Added `apply.go` implementing validate->simulate->commit pipeline, simulation acceptability heuristic, dry-run & force paths, rollback support; updated simulation to include Acceptable flag. Tests cover dry-run, commit, simulation rejection/force, rollback version increment. Next: Iteration 6 (observability events + metrics hooks).

- 2025-09-27T00:00:00Z | Iteration 6 (observability: events + metrics) | Added `events.go` (Dispatcher, ChangeEvent, InMemoryCollector) and `metrics.go` (MetricsRecorder interface, InMemoryMetrics). Enhanced `apply.go` to emit success/failure events and record metrics (apply success/failure, rollback count, active version gauge). Added `observability_test.go` validating event emission for apply, simulation rejection, and rollback plus metric counters. All tests green. Next: Iteration 7 (hardening: corruption tests, race detection, additional edge cases).

- 2025-09-27T00:00:00Z | Iteration 7 (hardening) | Added `hardening_test.go` with corruption detection test (tampered hash triggers `ErrHashMismatch`), nil spec apply validation test, rollback nonexistent version error test, and concurrent access stress test (intended for race detector). Verified all new and existing tests pass. Next: finalize documentation & readiness for deferred CLI (Iteration 8 / later phase) or expand persistence/metrics integration if prioritized.
