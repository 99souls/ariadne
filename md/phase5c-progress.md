## Entries

- 2025-09-27T00:00:00Z | Iteration 1 (scaffolding) | Added `configx` package with `model.go`, `layers.go`; introduced basic tests for layer precedence and model marshaling; deferred CLI scope per revised instructions. Next: implement resolver + deep merge (Iteration 2) after verifying coverage & lint.
- 2025-09-27T00:00:00Z | Iteration 2 (resolver + deep merge) | Added `resolver.go` with deep merge semantics (scalars override, slices replace, maps merge, cloning to avoid mutation); tests cover precedence, map merging, slice replacement & immutability. Next: Iteration 3 (store + versioning + hashing).
