  - `packages/engine/crawler/fetcher_test.go` - Comprehensive test suite

### Step 2: Enhanced Processor Interface (TDD) ✅

- Status: **COMPLETE** ✅
- Test Coverage: 8/8 tests passing (interface + integration tests)
- Code Quality: Lint compliance verified (0 issues)
- Backward Compatibility: Full compatibility adapter implemented
- Files Created:
  - `packages/engine/processor/processor.go` - Enhanced interface definition
  - `packages/engine/processor/compatibility.go` - Compatibility adapter with existing processor
  - `packages/engine/processor/processor_test.go` - Comprehensive test suite with integration tests

### Step 3: Enhanced OutputSink Interface (TDD) ✅

- Status: **COMPLETE** ✅
- Test Coverage: 10/10 tests passing (interface + composition + integration tests)
- Code Quality: Lint compliance verified (0 issues)
- Backward Compatibility: Full compatibility with existing OutputSink interface
- Files Created:
  - `packages/engine/output/enhanced_sink.go` - Enhanced interface definitions and policies
  - `packages/engine/output/enhanced_sink_impl.go` - Reference implementation with policy support
  - `packages/engine/output/composite_sink.go` - Composite and routing sink implementations
  - `packages/engine/output/enhanced_sink_test.go` - Comprehensive test suite with transformations

### Step 4: Strategy-Aware Engine Constructor

- [ ] Add EngineStrategies struct for dependency injection
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility with existing constructor
- [ ] Integration tests for strategy injection

### Step 5: Configuration Unification Foundation

- [ ] Design unified business policy configuration
- [ ] Create validation and default systems
- [ ] Test configuration edge cases and validation
