## Phase 5B Progress Tracking

### Step 1: Business Logic Migration ✅

**Status**: **COMPLETE** ✅  
**Completion Date**: September 27, 2025  
**Test Coverage**: 29/29 tests passing  
**Code Quality**: Zero linting issues  
**Implementation Time**: ~2 hours

**Achievements**:

- ✅ **Crawler Business Logic Consolidation**: Created comprehensive `packages/engine/business/crawler/` package
- ✅ **Policy-Based Decision Making**: Implemented `CrawlingBusinessPolicy` with 4 policy domains
- ✅ **Business Decision Engine**: Created `CrawlingDecisionMaker` for intelligent crawling decisions
- ✅ **Site-Specific Rules**: Implemented `SitePolicyManager` with pattern matching and rule inheritance
- ✅ **Comprehensive Testing**: 29 tests covering all business logic scenarios

**Files Created**:

- `packages/engine/business/crawler/policies.go` (103 lines) - Core policy structures and evaluation logic
- `packages/engine/business/crawler/policies_test.go` (290 lines) - Comprehensive policy testing
- `packages/engine/business/crawler/decisions.go` (108 lines) - Business decision-making logic
- `packages/engine/business/crawler/decisions_test.go` (175 lines) - Decision testing with integration scenarios
- `packages/engine/business/crawler/sites.go` (122 lines) - Site-specific policy management
- `packages/engine/business/crawler/sites_test.go` (222 lines) - Site policy testing with pattern matching

**Business Logic Consolidation**:

1. **URL Allowance Decisions**: Moved from `internal/crawler.isAllowedURL()` to policy-based evaluation
2. **Link Following Logic**: Extracted depth and external link rules from hardcoded crawler logic
3. **Content Selection**: Centralized selector logic with site-specific overrides
4. **Rate Limiting Rules**: Business-level rate limiting policies with domain-specific settings

**Architecture Benefits Achieved**:

- ✅ **Policy-Driven**: All crawling decisions now configurable through business policies
- ✅ **Site-Specific**: Fine-grained control over site-specific crawling behavior
- ✅ **Testable**: Business logic completely isolated and unit-testable
- ✅ **Extensible**: Clear patterns for adding new business rules and policies

**Integration Points Prepared**:

- Ready for integration with existing `CollyFetcher` implementation
- Business policies can be configured through `UnifiedBusinessConfig`
- Decision context supports distributed crawling scenarios

### Step 2: Processor Business Logic Migration ✅

**Status**: **COMPLETE** ✅  
**Completion Date**: September 27, 2025  
**Test Coverage**: 20/20 tests passing  
**Code Quality**: Zero linting issues  

**Achievements**:

- ✅ **Content Processing Policy System**: Implemented `ContentProcessingPolicy` for content extraction, cleaning, and transformation rules
- ✅ **Content Quality Policy System**: Created `ContentQualityPolicy` for validation requirements and quality standards
- ✅ **Processing Decision Engine**: Built `ProcessingDecisionMaker` for intelligent content processing decisions
- ✅ **Content Validation Framework**: Implemented `ContentValidationPolicyEvaluator` with comprehensive validation rules
- ✅ **Quality Analysis System**: Created `ContentQualityAnalyzer` for content density, quality scoring, and reading time estimation

**Files Created**:

- `packages/engine/business/processor/content.go` (185 lines) - Core content processing business logic
- `packages/engine/business/processor/content_test.go` (200 lines) - Content processing tests
- `packages/engine/business/processor/validation.go` (215 lines) - Content validation business logic  
- `packages/engine/business/processor/validation_test.go` (230 lines) - Validation tests

**Business Logic Consolidation**:

1. **Content Processing Decisions**: Policy-driven content extraction, cleaning, and transformation
2. **Quality Validation**: Configurable validation rules for word count, title length, content structure
3. **Processing Steps Configuration**: Dynamic processing pipeline based on policy settings
4. **Content Analysis**: Quality scoring, density analysis, and reading time estimation

### Step 3: Output Business Logic Migration ✅

**Status**: **COMPLETE** ✅  
**Completion Date**: September 27, 2025  
**Test Coverage**: 12/12 tests passing  
**Code Quality**: Zero linting issues  

**Achievements**:

- ✅ **Output Processing Policy System**: Implemented `OutputProcessingPolicy` for format, compression, buffering, and retry settings
- ✅ **Output Quality Policy System**: Created `OutputQualityPolicy` for size limits, format validation, and integrity checks
- ✅ **Output Decision Engine**: Built `OutputDecisionMaker` for intelligent output processing decisions
- ✅ **Output Routing System**: Implemented `OutputRoutingDecisionMaker` with pattern matching and sink routing

**Files Created**:

- `packages/engine/business/output/output.go` (295 lines) - Core output processing business logic
- `packages/engine/business/output/output_test.go` (230 lines) - Output processing tests

**Business Logic Consolidation**:

1. **Output Processing Decisions**: Policy-driven format selection, compression, and buffering
2. **Quality Validation**: Size limits, format restrictions, and content integrity checks
3. **Output Configuration**: Dynamic configuration based on URL and policy evaluation
4. **Routing Decisions**: Pattern-based sink routing with fallback mechanisms

## Phase 5B Step 1 Summary ✅

**Overall Status**: **COMPLETE** ✅  
**Total Implementation Time**: ~3 hours  
**Total Tests Created**: 61 tests (29 crawler + 20 processor + 12 output)  
**Code Quality**: Zero linting issues across all modules  
**Architecture Achievement**: Complete business logic consolidation

**Key Architectural Transformations**:
