## Phase 5A Progress Tracking

### Step 1: Fetcher Interface Design ✅

- Status: **COMPLETE** ✅
- Test Coverage: 8/8 tests passing
- Code Quality: Lint compliance verified (0 issues)
- Error Handling: Comprehensive error checking added
- Files Created:
  - `packages/engine/crawler/fetcher.go` - Interface definition
  - `packages/engine/crawler/colly_fetcher.go` - Colly implementation
  - `packages/engine/crawler/fetcher_test.go` - Comprehensive test suite

### Step 2: Enhanced Processor Interface (TDD) ✅

- Status: **COMPLETE** ✅
- Test Coverage: 8/8 tests passing (interface + integration tests)
- Code Quality: Lint compliance verified (0 issues)
- Backward Compatibility: Full compatibility adapter implemented
- Files Created:
  - `packages/engine/processor/processor.go` - Enhanced interface definition
  - `packages/engine/processor/compatibility.go` - Compatibility adapter with existing processor
  - `packages/engine/processor/processor_test.go` - Comprehensive test suite with integration tests

### Step 3: Enhanced OutputSink Interface (TDD) ✅

- Status: **COMPLETE** ✅
- Test Coverage: 10/10 tests passing (interface + composition + integration tests)
- Code Quality: Lint compliance verified (0 issues)
- Backward Compatibility: Full compatibility with existing OutputSink interface
- Files Created:
  - `packages/engine/output/enhanced_sink.go` - Enhanced interface definitions and policies
  - `packages/engine/output/enhanced_sink_impl.go` - Reference implementation with policy support
  - `packages/engine/output/composite_sink.go` - Composite and routing sink implementations
  - `packages/engine/output/enhanced_sink_test.go` - Comprehensive test suite with transformations

### Step 4: Strategy-Aware Engine Constructor

- [ ] Add EngineStrategies struct for dependency injection
- [ ] Maintain backward compatibility with existing constructor
- [ ] Integration tests for strategy injection

### Step 5: Configuration Unification Foundation ✅

**Status**: COMPLETED - All requirements implemented with comprehensive testing

**Implementation**: 
- Created `packages/engine/config` package with unified configuration system
- Implemented `UnifiedBusinessConfig` with all component policies and global settings
- Built comprehensive validation system with edge case handling
- Created intelligent defaults system with value preservation
- Added configuration composition and legacy migration support
- Achieved 47 tests passing with zero lint issues

**Key Achievements**:
- Unified business policy configuration across Fetcher, Processor, OutputSink
- Comprehensive validation and default systems with boundary condition handling
- Multi-environment configuration support (development/production)
- Performance-optimized validation and creation (< 100ms for 1000 operations)
- Full backward compatibility with existing policy structures
- Configuration hot-reloading and migration patterns

**Files Added**:
- `packages/engine/config/unified_config.go` (449 lines)
- `packages/engine/config/unified_config_test.go` (24 tests)
- `packages/engine/config/advanced_config_test.go` (16 tests)  
- `packages/engine/config/integration_test.go` (7 tests)

**Architecture Benefits**:
- Single source of truth for all engine configuration
- Policy-driven validation with descriptive error messages
- Flexible composition patterns for various use cases
- Foundation for Phase 5B implementation integration

**Quality Metrics**:
- 47 comprehensive tests passing
- Zero golangci-lint issues
- 100% compilation success across all engine packages
- Performance benchmarks within acceptable bounds
