## Phase 5B Progress Tracking

### Step 1: Business Logic Migration ✅

**Status**: **COMPLETE** ✅  
**Completion Date**: September 27, 2025  
**Test Coverage**: 29/29 tests passing  
**Code Quality**: Zero linting issues  
**Implementation Time**: ~2 hours

**Achievements**:

- ✅ **Crawler Business Logic Consolidation**: Created comprehensive `packages/engine/business/crawler/` package
- ✅ **Policy-Based Decision Making**: Implemented `CrawlingBusinessPolicy` with 4 policy domains
- ✅ **Business Decision Engine**: Created `CrawlingDecisionMaker` for intelligent crawling decisions
- ✅ **Site-Specific Rules**: Implemented `SitePolicyManager` with pattern matching and rule inheritance
- ✅ **Comprehensive Testing**: 29 tests covering all business logic scenarios

**Files Created**:

- `packages/engine/business/crawler/policies.go` (103 lines) - Core policy structures and evaluation logic
- `packages/engine/business/crawler/policies_test.go` (290 lines) - Comprehensive policy testing
- `packages/engine/business/crawler/decisions.go` (108 lines) - Business decision-making logic
- `packages/engine/business/crawler/decisions_test.go` (175 lines) - Decision testing with integration scenarios
- `packages/engine/business/crawler/sites.go` (122 lines) - Site-specific policy management
- `packages/engine/business/crawler/sites_test.go` (222 lines) - Site policy testing with pattern matching

**Business Logic Consolidation**:

1. **URL Allowance Decisions**: Moved from `internal/crawler.isAllowedURL()` to policy-based evaluation
2. **Link Following Logic**: Extracted depth and external link rules from hardcoded crawler logic
3. **Content Selection**: Centralized selector logic with site-specific overrides
4. **Rate Limiting Rules**: Business-level rate limiting policies with domain-specific settings

**Architecture Benefits Achieved**:

- ✅ **Policy-Driven**: All crawling decisions now configurable through business policies
- ✅ **Site-Specific**: Fine-grained control over site-specific crawling behavior
- ✅ **Testable**: Business logic completely isolated and unit-testable
- ✅ **Extensible**: Clear patterns for adding new business rules and policies

**Integration Points Prepared**:

- Ready for integration with existing `CollyFetcher` implementation
- Business policies can be configured through `UnifiedBusinessConfig`
- Decision context supports distributed crawling scenarios
