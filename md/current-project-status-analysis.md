## 3. Phase 5 Analysis & Roadmap

### 3.1 Phase 5 Strategic Analysis âœ… COMPLETE

**Status**: âœ… **Analysis Complete**  
**Document**: [phase5-engine-architecture-analysis.md](./phase5-engine-architecture-analysis.md)

**Key Findings**:

- Engine facade is functional but lacks domain authority
- Business logic remains fragmented across `internal/` packages
- Interface boundaries need standardization for strategy injection
- Core business decisions are embedded in implementation details
- Migration to engine-centric architecture requires systematic refactoring

**Strategic Assessment**:

- Current state: ðŸŸ¡ **Partially Achieved** - Facade exists but lacks domain authority
- Target state: ðŸŽ¯ **Engine as Single Source of Truth**
- Migration effort: **High** - Requires 6-8 phases of careful refactoring

### 3.2 Identified Architectural Gaps

1. **Business Logic Fragmentation**: Core decisions scattered across internal packages
2. **Insufficient Interface Boundaries**: Concrete implementations instead of strategies
3. **Missing Domain Abstractions**: No clear business layer interfaces
4. **Configuration Inflexibility**: Hardcoded behaviors in internal components
5. **Limited Extensibility**: Difficult to add new processing strategies
