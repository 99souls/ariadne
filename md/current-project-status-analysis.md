# Ariadne Project Status Analysis - Current State Assessment

**Status**: Updated Analysis (Phase 5D COMPLETE)  
**Date**: September 27, 2025  
**Companion to**: [phase5-engine-architecture-analysis.md](./phase5-engine-architecture-analysis.md)  
**Purpose**: Comprehensive assessment of completed work and remaining development phases (now including Phase 5D completion)

---

## Executive Summary

Ariadne has now successfully completed **Phases 1â€“4**, **Phase 5A Interface Standardization**, **Phase 5B Business Logic Consolidation**, and **Phase 5D Asset Strategy Integration**. (Phase numbering adjustment: original roadmap slotted configuration as 5C and output strategies as 5D; asset strategy integration was accelerated and executed as 5D on this feature branch.) The engine now owns asset discovery, decision, execution, optimization, and rewrite as a first-class, policy-driven business subsystem with deterministic behavior, concurrency controls, and instrumentation. Phase 5D shipped with a stable worker pool, extended asset discovery (including srcset, preload, media sources, document anchors), deterministic hashed output paths, atomic metrics, and documentation (architecture appendix, migration guide, policy reference, completion plan). Benchmarks established a baseline for future optimization.

## 3. Phase 5 Analysis & Roadmap

### 3.1 Phase 5 Strategic Analysis âœ… COMPLETE

**Status**: âœ… **Analysis Complete**  
**Document**: [phase5-engine-architecture-analysis.md](./phase5-engine-architecture-analysis.md)

**Key Findings**:

- Engine facade is functional but lacks domain authority
- Business logic remains fragmented across `internal/` packages
- Interface boundaries need standardization for strategy injection
- Core business decisions are embedded in implementation details
- Migration to engine-centric architecture requires systematic refactoring

**Strategic Assessment**:

- Current state: ðŸŸ¡ **Partially Achieved** - Facade exists but lacks domain authority
- Target state: ðŸŽ¯ **Engine as Single Source of Truth**
- Migration effort: **High** - Requires 6-8 phases of careful refactoring

### 3.2 Identified Architectural Gaps

1. **Business Logic Fragmentation**: Core decisions scattered across internal packages
2. **Insufficient Interface Boundaries**: Concrete implementations instead of strategies
3. **Missing Domain Abstractions**: No clear business layer interfaces
4. **Configuration Inflexibility**: Hardcoded behaviors in internal components
5. **Limited Extensibility**: Difficult to add new processing strategies

- âœ… **Test Infrastructure**: Comprehensive testing framework ready for business logic validation

### Phase 5B: Business Logic Consolidation âœ… FULLY COMPLETE

**Objective**: Centralize business decision-making in the engine layer

**Status**: âœ… **All 5 steps delivered**  
**Test Count**: 138 focused tests (policies, strategies, runtime config, monitoring, business outcomes)  
**Backward Compatibility**: Maintained (no breaking API changes introduced)  
**Performance**: Subâ€‘millisecond interface dispatch preserved; no regressions detected

**Delivered Steps**:

- âœ… **Step 1** Business Logic Migration â€“ Business rules (crawler, processor, output) moved to `packages/engine/business/*`; adapters retained isolation
- âœ… **Step 2** Enhanced Policy System â€“ Unified policy & rule modeling (`policies` package) + validation & retrieval methods
- âœ… **Step 3** Strategy Composition â€“ Composable strategies with fetching/processing/output orchestration & optimization scaffolding
- âœ… **Step 4** Runtime Configuration â€“ Live-adjustable runtime settings, foundation for hot reloading & future staged rollouts
- âœ… **Step 5** Advanced Monitoring â€“ Business metrics, Prometheus exporter, OpenTelemetry tracing (provider initialized), structured logging, health checks

**Key Artifacts**:

- `packages/engine/business/*` â€“ Canonical business layer
- `packages/engine/strategies/` â€“ Composition, optimization & performance tracking
- `packages/engine/monitoring/` â€“ Integrated metrics, tracing & health endpoints
- Updated tests enforcing engine-centric authority & policy behavior

**Benefits Achieved**:

- Centralized decision logic â†’ Easier governance & optimization
- Extensibility unlocked (future plugin / multi-tenant paths clearer)
- Observability elevated to business semantics (rule success, strategy efficacy)
- Stable substrate for advanced configuration (Phase 5C) & distribution (later phases)

### Phase 5C: Configuration & Policy Management âœ… COMPLETE (Recap)

**Objective**: Elevate configuration to a first-class, hierarchical, dynamic, auditable system supporting rule evolution, staged rollout, and safe experimentation.

**High-Level Targets (Preview)**:

1. Hierarchical layered config (global â†’ environment â†’ domain â†’ site â†’ transient overrides)
2. Rule lifecycle management (create, validate, simulate, activate, rollback)
3. Hot reload with atomic apply & health gating
4. Versioning + audit trail (immutable history, signed provenance hooks)
5. A/B & canary policy rollout (percentage or domain cohort based)
6. Drift detection & integrity verification
7. Configuration impact telemetry (latency delta, success rate delta, rule hit cardinality)
8. CLI & programmatic APIs for safe management

Full execution plan defined in forthcoming `PHASE5C_INSTRUCTIONS.md` (added separately).

### Phase 5D: Asset Strategy Integration âœ… COMPLETE (Accelerated Replacement of Prior 5D Placeholder)

**Objective (Delivered)**: Extract and operationalize asset handling (discovery â†’ decision â†’ download/inline â†’ optimize â†’ rewrite) as a policy-driven, concurrent, deterministic Engine subsystem.

**Key Deliverables**:
- AssetStrategy interface + default implementation
- Extended discovery coverage (img/src & srcset, source[srcset], preload rel=stylesheet/script/image, media sources, document asset anchors)
- Policy surface (enable, limits, concurrency, inline thresholds, optimization toggle, rewrite prefix)
- Deterministic hashed path scheme (`/assets/<first2>/<fullhash><ext>`) supporting future caching/CDN layers
- Concurrency: bounded worker pool (`MaxConcurrent`, CPU capped)
- Metrics & events (discovered, selected, downloaded, failed, skipped, inlined, optimized, bytes in/out, rewrite failures; download events with optimization info)
- Race safety: atomic counters + mutex-protected event ring
- Failure isolation: per-asset error does not abort page processing; failed counter increments without affecting bytes
- Benchmarked baseline (AssetExecute ns/op, allocs/op) recorded
- Documentation set: architecture appendix, migration guide, asset policy reference, finalized phase plan

**Deferred Items**:
- Multi-variant srcset materialization
- Advanced image/media optimization (transcoding, format conversion)
- External CDN / cache integration
- Exporter wiring for asset metrics/events (moved to Phase 5E)

**Rationale for Roadmap Adjustment**: Early asset consolidation reduced duplication in processor path and enabled cleaner observability instrumentation planning for the upcoming monitoring phase.

### Phase 5E: Monitoring & Observability ðŸŽ¯ NEXT

**Objective**: Elevate observability from basic in-process counters to production-grade, externally consumable telemetry (metrics, traces, structured events, health & readiness) with low overhead and clear SLO baselines.

**Planned High-Level Work (See `phase5e-plan.md` once added)**:
- Metrics Exporters: Prometheus (pull) & OpenTelemetry bridge (push/OTLP)
- Unified Telemetry Interface: abstraction enabling pluggable exporters or no-op mode
- Event Bus: Replace bounded ring with subscription-based fan-out (in-memory to start)
- Tracing Spans: Crawl session â†’ page fetch â†’ processing â†’ asset sub-operations â†’ rate limit decisions
- Structured Logging Enhancements: Correlation IDs, component field taxonomy, log level policy
- Health / Readiness / Liveness Endpoints: JSON status + component metrics snapshot
- Config Change Impact Metrics: Latency deltas, error-rate shifts, rule hit distribution (ties into 5C runtime config)
- Dashboards & SLO Definitions: Initial Grafana templates (crawl throughput, error budget, asset failure rate, rate limiter adaptation curves)
- Performance Budget: <5% CPU overhead & <10% memory overhead with full telemetry enabled

**Exit Criteria (Preview)**:
- All core internal counters exported via Prometheus endpoint (or injectable registry)
- Optional OTEL tracing with parent context propagation and span attributes (URL, domain, asset type)
- Event bus supports at least one subscriber (logger) + future external forwarder hook
- Health endpoints return green status under normal load; degrade gracefully (partial component errors flagged) without panics
- Tests validate: metrics cardinality, race safety, exporter toggling, minimal overhead benchmark snapshot

Full detailed plan in new `phase5e-plan.md` (added alongside this update).

### Phase 5F: Multi-Module Architecture ðŸŽ¯ PLANNED

**Objective**: Package for distribution and reuse
**Priority**: Low
**Effort**: High

**Planned Work**:

- Split into multiple Go modules
- Create plugin system for extensions
- Establish semantic versioning
- Build distribution packages
