# (Archived) ConfigX Documentation

These documents described the now-removed experimental dynamic configuration subsystem ("ConfigX").
The subsystem was deleted in September 2025 (see `md/decisions/2025-09-configx-removal.md`).
They are preserved only for historical reference and will not be updated.

Archived files:
- config-api.md
- config-platform-overview.md
- config-operations-guide.md
- config-asset-policy.md (if present)

Rationale for removal: reduced surface area, avoided premature complexity, favored static `engine.Config`.

Any new configuration needs should start with explicit evolution proposals referencing the ADR above.
